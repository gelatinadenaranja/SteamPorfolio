# SteamPorfolio
  
## Introduction
Hello, this is a lil' project that aims at helping people manage their [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) investments which can be any in-game [item that's marketable](https://steamcommunity.com/market/).
For more information about these kind of investments visit the [CS:GO Steam Market Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/csgomarketforum/) forum.
  
## Classes' short description of their role
- MainForm: Initialize the main panel from which the user manages their items.
- Additempopup: Create a panel used for adding new items.
- Dbconnector: Manage all database interactions.
- Settings: Read and write the program's settings.
- ButtonColumn: Allow usage of buttons in JTable.
- Itemaddform: Test class, forgot to move it.
  
    
  Note: Everything in the folder *testclasses* is, indeed, used **ONLY** for testing purposes. All that code is a mess that doesn't make sense, ignore it.
